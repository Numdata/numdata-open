Quote from http://mazenl77.deviantart.com/ about use of these icons:

Here's some questions people keep e-mailing me. If you're planning on e-mailing me, please check if the answer is written here.

1. Do you do requests?
No
2. Do you do requests for money?
No
3a. May I use your icon(s) in my project?
Sure, as long as the icon is not originally copyrighted (such as the MSN logo, Reason logo, etc.
3b. May I still use your icon(s) in my project if I charge money for the project?
Sure
4. What happened to all your icons?
Long story short: I gave everyone permission to use my icons anywhere, forgetting the fact that not everyone knows about all the copyrighted icons. Some company used the Reason logo in their application, whoops. Decided it was best to just delete everything.
5. What program do you use to make the icons and emoticons?
Mainly Ulead PhotoImpact 12 for emoticons and mainly Xara Xtreme for icons. I love Xara, it's easy and fast... Took me months to learn to work with PhotoImpact, but with Xara I found pretty much everything after 2 days.
6. How come you don't charge money for the icons?
Mainly because it is a hobby of mine, and I want as many people as possible to enjoy them. Googling my nick and finding random desktop threads screenshots with my icons in them is very satisfying after making them. I probably won't find a lot of those screenshots if I charge money for the icons...
